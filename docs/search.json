    "text": "Titanic\nThe Titanic was a large passenger ship that departed from England in 1912. During its maiden voyage, the ship tragically collided with an iceberg and sank, resulting in the deaths of approximately 1,500 people. The film Titanic, directed by James Cameron in 1997, is a romance-disaster movie that tells a fictional love story set against the backdrop of this historical event. The movie portrays the grandeur of the ship, the social divide between the upper and lower classes, and the emotional turmoil of the characters as the disaster unfolds. It blends historical facts with imaginative storytelling to depict both the tragedy of the sinking and the intimate, human experiences that could have occurred during that fateful voyage.\n\n\n\nFigure: Poster image from Titanic (1997), depicting the iconic scene of Jack and Rose at the ship’s bow."

His ticket is for third class, which is the cheapest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEM0I3ltp7M\nRose DeWitt Bukater is already on the ship at the beginning of the movie. She gets on the Titanic with her boyfriend Cal and her mother. They are rich and get special treatment. Rose wears fancy clothes, eats expensive food, and stays in a beautiful room.

But this chaos is not delivered equally to everyone on board.\nIn the film, a clear difference is shown between first-class and third-class passengers. First-class passengers are quickly and politely informed by crew members. They receive calm explanations, are given life jackets, and are carefully guided toward the lifeboats. They are seen dressing in formal clothes and preparing for evacuation in an orderly manner.\nMeanwhile, third-class passengers go a long time without any information about the accident. Many find the stairways and corridors blocked, unable to reach the upper decks. Families wander the ship in confusion, and others wait helplessly behind locked gates— a powerful image of the class-based gap in access to survival.\nAmid the growing panic, Rose’s fiancé, Cal, begins to search for her. As a wealthy gentleman, he urges Rose to get on a lifeboat and escape with him.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmw1q0CprEA"

These commands help you understand what the data looks like, how many variables it contains, and how it’s organized. Below are some of the most useful pandas functions for this purpose:\n\ndf.shape: Returns the overall dimensions of the DataFrame as a tuple (rows, columns). This helps you quickly understand how many observations (rows) and variables (columns) the dataset contains.\ndf.columns: Displays a list of all column names in the DataFrame. This allows you to explicitly check what variables are included.\ndf.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types of each column, the number of non-null entries, and memory usage. It is especially useful for detecting missing values and distinguishing between numeric and categorical variables.\ndf.head() / df.tail(): Shows the first (or last) few rows of the dataset. This gives you a quick preview of actual values, formatting, and data units, making it easier to get a sense of how the data is structured.\ndf.describe(): Generates summary statistics for numeric columns, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. It helps in identifying variable scales, distributions, and potential outliers early in the analysis."

But before we dive in, let’s take a moment to briefly introduce what a decision tree actually is.\nA Decision Tree is a machine learning model that works much like the game of 20 Questions. In that game, one person thinks of an object (like an animal or a job), and the other person tries to guess it by asking a series of yes/no questions such as: “Can it fly?”, “Does it have four legs?”, or “Is it a human?” Each question helps narrow down the possibilities, and with enough well-chosen questions, the answer eventually becomes clear.\nA decision tree follows the same idea. Given some data, it makes a prediction by asking a series of simple, binary questions. In the Titanic survival prediction task, for example, a decision tree might ask:\n\n“Is the passenger female?”\n“Is the ticket class 1st class?”\n“Is the passenger under 10 years old?”"

    "text": "Titanic: From Intuition to ML\nEach question divides the data into two branches — those that meet the condition and those that don’t. By following these branches step by step, the tree gradually narrows down the group of passengers and finally reaches a prediction, such as “Survived” or “Did not survive.” This final prediction is stored in what’s called a leaf node of the tree.\nWhat makes decision trees especially useful is their simplicity and interpretability. They don’t require complex math or feature transformations, and the decision path for each prediction can be traced back in plain language. This makes them easy to understand and explain — even to someone without a background in machine learning.\nIn summary, a decision tree is like a smart version of 20 Questions: it figures out what questions to ask based on the data, and uses the answers to make accurate predictions."

The code below creates a decision tree model with default settings:\n\nmodel = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)\n\nThe DecisionTreeClassifier model object works primarily through two key methods: fit() and predict(). The .fit(X, y) method is used to train the model by learning patterns in the data. It takes the input features X and the corresponding target labels y, and builds a tree structure that splits the data based on conditions like “Is the passenger female?” or “Is the ticket class 1st class?” The goal is to find the best questions (or splits) that help classify the target variable as accurately as possible. Once the model is trained, the .predict(X_test) method can be used to make predictions on new data. For each row in X_test, the model follows the learned decision rules down the tree to arrive at a prediction, such as whether a passenger survived or not. In short, .fit() builds the decision rules from training data, and .predict() applies those rules to make predictions."

Models will be saved in: \"AutogluonModels/ag-20251103_124336\"\n\n\nWhat does TabularPredictor mean?\nThe term “tabular” refers to data organized in rows and columns — like spreadsheets or pandas DataFrames. This format is typical for structured datasets such as Titanic passenger records.\nUnlike traditional approaches where a single model (e.g., decision tree) is manually selected, AutoGluon automatically trains and compares a variety of powerful algorithms — such as gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks. It then selects or combines the top-performing ones to generate robust predictions.\nIn short, TabularPredictor manages the entire process for tabular datasets — from training multiple models to picking the most effective strategy — with minimal code required."
